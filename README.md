Some background - information about earlier implementations...

Main sense:
Ontology, semantics � the main words for Canonical Business Model system architecture. Even for very simple (as it may looks) Information system � put in the foundation level the very upper ontology. Concepts inheritance tree won�t be too deep. But your system will answer easily for many unpredictable questions. Or will be easily expanded (not changed!) for that.
